<h1>Earth & Mars: The Inner Planets</h1>
</header>
<main><img src="file:///D:/alaisah/Life-on-Earth-and-Mars.jpg" alt="Earth & Mars">
<p>  Earth and Mars are the two planets along with six other planets. These two planets in our solar system have a few geological similarities such as Mars is one-half the diameter of the Earth and the amount of dry land surface present on both the planets is the same.  </p>
<h2>Earth</h2>
<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system and the only known celestial body to harbor life. It's the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. It's home to a wide variety of ecosystems, including oceans, forests, deserts, and grasslands, which support an incredibly diverse range of organisms.</p>
<p>Earth has a relatively thin atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen and oxygen, which supports life by moderating the planet's temperature and protecting it from harmful solar radiation. Its surface is predominantly covered by water, with oceans comprising about 71% of its surface area.</p>
<p>The planet has a solid outer shell, known as the lithosphere, which is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath. These plates are in constant motion, leading to phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of mountain ranges.</p>
<p>
<h3>Characteristics of Earth</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Third planet from the Sun in our solar system.</li>
  <li>Only known celestial body to support life.</li>
  <li>Terrestrial planet with a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles).</li>
  <li>Has a relatively thin atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%), with trace amounts of other gases.</li>
  <li>About 71% of the Earth's surface is covered by oceans, with the remaining 29% consisting of continents and islands.</li>
  <li>Dynamic surface shaped by processes such as plate tectonics, erosion, and volcanic activity.</li>
  <li>Home to a vast array of life forms, from microscopic bacteria to large mammals, within its biosphere.</li>
  <li>Has a magnetic field generated by its molten iron core, which helps protect the planet from solar wind and cosmic radiation.</li>
</ol>
</p>

    <h2>Mars</h2>
<p>Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, has fascinated humanity for centuries with its red hue and mysterious landscape.  Recent advancements in space exploration have enabled us to probe deeper into the planet's secrets, revealing clues about its past and potential for life.</p>
<p> While Mars' harsh surface conditions present challenges, ongoing robotic missions, like NASA's Perseverance rover, are tirelessly searching for signs of ancient microbial life and paving the way for future human exploration. </p>
<p>Despite the immense challenges of sending humans to Mars, plans for crewed missions are in motion, offering hope for a future where humanity extends its reach beyond Earth. Mars represents a frontier of exploration and discovery, holding the promise of unlocking the secrets of our neighboring planet and inspiring generations to come.</p>
<p><h2>Characteristics of Mars</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system.</li>
  <li>Often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface.</li>
  <li>Terrestrial planet with a diameter of about 6,779 kilometers (4,212 miles).</li>
  <li>Has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and argon.</li>
  <li>Surface features include vast deserts, canyons, and polar ice caps composed mainly of water and carbon dioxide ice.</li>
  <li>Has the highest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the deepest canyon, Valles Marineris.</li>
  <li>Surface temperature varies widely, ranging from about -87째C (-125째F) at the poles to 20째C (68째F) near the equator.</li>
  <li>Has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured asteroids.</li>
