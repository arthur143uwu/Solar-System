    <p>
        Mercury and Venus are the two innermost planets of our Solar System, both orbiting closer to the Sun than Earth. Despite their proximity, they exhibit distinct characteristics and environments.
    </p>
    <h2>Mercury</h2>
    <p>
        Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its surface is heavily cratered, resembling Earth's moon, and it lacks significant atmosphere or moons. Due to its proximity to the Sun, temperatures on Mercury can reach extreme highs during the day and drop drastically at night.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mercury's surface is composed mainly of rocky material and is thought to have a large iron core, making it one of the densest planets in the Solar System. Despite its small size, Mercury experiences tectonic activity, evidenced by scarps and ridges on its surface.
<h3> Characteristics</h3>
    </p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Closest planet to the Sun in our solar system.</li>
  <li>Smallest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles).</li>
  <li>Surface temperature ranges from extremely hot (430°C/800°F) during the day to extremely cold (-180°C/-290°F) at night due to its thin atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Mercury has a heavily cratered surface, resembling the Moon, due to impacts from asteroids and comets.</li>
  <li>Has a very slow rotation, completing just 3 rotations on its axis for every 2 orbits around the Sun, resulting in extreme temperature variations between its day and night sides.</li>
  <li>Mercury has no moons and no significant atmosphere, making it vulnerable to impacts from solar wind and cosmic radiation.</li>
  <li>Surface features include large plains, cliffs, and scarps caused by the planet's contraction as its iron core cooled and solidified.</li>
</ol>
</p>
    <h2>Venus</h2>
    <p>
        Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition, but its environment is vastly different. It has a thick atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that makes it the hottest planet in the Solar System.
    </p>
    <p>
        The surface of Venus is shrouded in perpetual cloud cover, making direct observation difficult. However, radar mapping has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic features, including vast plains, towering volcanoes, and deep canyons. Despite its inhospitable surface conditions, Venus may have had oceans in its distant past.
    </p>
<p>
<h3>Characteristics of Venus</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Second planet from the Sun in our solar system.</li>
  <li>Similar in size to Earth, with a diameter of about 12,104 kilometers (7,521 miles).</li>
  <li>Often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition.</li>
  <li>Has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a strong greenhouse effect that traps heat.</li>
  <li>Surface temperature averages around 462°C (864°F), making it the hottest planet in our solar system, even hotter than Mercury despite being farther from the Sun.</li>
  <li>Rotates very slowly on its axis, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, but orbits the Sun relatively quickly, completing one orbit in about 225 Earth days.</li>
  <li>Surface features include vast plains, highland regions, and thousands of volcanoes, including the massive shield volcano called Maxwell Montes.</li>
  <li>Has no moons and no magnetic field.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Mercury and Venus are also called inferior planets for they are near the sun unlike any other planets.
    </p>
<p>
        Both Mercury and Venus have been explored by spacecraft, providing valuable insights into their geological processes and atmospheres. Understanding these inner planets not only sheds light on the formation and evolution of our Solar System but also offers clues to the potential diversity of exoplanetary systems beyond.
