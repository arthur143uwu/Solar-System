<h2>Uranus</h2>
<p>Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, presents a multitude of unique characteristics that continue to fascinate scientists and astronomers. Its extreme axial tilt, rotating almost perpendicular to its orbital plane, results in extreme seasonal variations, offering insights into its formation and evolution. </p>
<p>Beyond its striking appearance, Jupiter's gravitational pull serves as a crucial guardian, deflecting asteroids and comets away from Earth and contributing to the stability of the solar system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Uranus boasts a captivating system of rings and moons, with 13 distinct rings and 27 known moons, including Titania, Oberon, Miranda, Ariel, and Umbriel. These moons provide valuable clues about the planet's geological and evolutionary history. </p>
<p>Discovered in 1781 by Sir William Herschel, Uranus remains a subject of exploration and study through spacecraft missions like Voyager 2 and observations from telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope. Uranus serves as a testament to the enduring curiosity of humankind and the boundless wonders of the cosmos.</p>
<p>
<h3>Characteristics</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Uranus rotates on its side, with an axial tilt of about 98 degrees, causing extreme seasonal variations lasting 42 years each.</li>
    <li>Primarily composed of hydrogen (83%) and helium (15%), with traces of methane (2%) and other elements.</li>
    <li>Has 13 known rings, discovered by Voyager 2 in 1977. These rings are relatively faint compared to those of Saturn and are composed of dark particles, likely containing water ice and organic material.</li>
    <li>Has 27 known moons, with the five largest being Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Miranda, the smallest of these five, exhibits a diverse and varied surface, indicating past geological activity.</li>
    <li>Officially discovered by Sir William Herschel on March 13, 1781. It was the first planet to be discovered using a telescope and expanded our understanding of the solar system's size and scale.</li>
    <li>Visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which conducted a flyby in 1986. The spacecraft provided valuable data about the planet's atmosphere, rings, and moons during its brief encounter.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>Neptune</h2>
<p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is a gas giant, similar in composition to Uranus, and is often referred to as an "ice giant" due to its composition primarily of hydrogen, helium, and icy materials like water, ammonia, and methane. </p>
<p>Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea, reflecting its deep blue color, which is attributed to the presence of methane in its atmosphere. </p>
<p>Discovered in 1846, Neptune has a system of faint rings and a retinue of 14 known moons, the largest of which is Triton, which is notable for its retrograde orbit and significant geological activity. Neptune is a dynamic and intriguing world that continues to fascinate astronomers and planetary scientists.</p>
<p>
<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<ol>
<li>Neptune is classified as a gas giant, similar to Jupiter and Saturn. It primarily consists of hydrogen, helium, and trace amounts of other gases like methane.</li>
<li>Neptune's atmosphere gives it a distinct blue coloration. This is due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects blue light.</li>
<li>Neptune experiences extremely dynamic weather patterns with high-speed winds and massive storms. The most famous of these is the Great Dark Spot, a giant storm system similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</li>
<li>Like other gas giants, Neptune has a system of rings. Although not as prominent as Saturn's rings, they consist of primarily dust and ice particles.</li>
<li>Neptune has 14 known moons, the largest of which is Triton. Triton is unusual because it orbits Neptune in a retrograde motion, suggesting that it may have been captured by Neptune's gravity rather than forming alongside the planet.</li>
<li>Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system, resulting in extremely cold temperatures. Its average surface temperature is around -214°C (-353°F).</li>
<li>Neptune has a powerful magnetic field, about 27 times stronger than Earth's. This magnetic field is tilted relative to its rotation axis, resulting in unusual magnetic field patterns.</li>
<li>Neptune rotates on its axis very quickly, completing a full rotation in about 16 hours. This rapid rotation causes its equatorial bulge to be more pronounced compared to other planets.</li>
<li>Despite its size, Neptune appears faint in the sky due to its distance from Earth. It is not visible to the naked eye and was not discovered until the use of telescopes.</li>
<li>Neptune is often compared to its neighboring ice giant, Uranus, due to similarities in size, composition, and structure. Both planets have a composition rich in ices and a blue appearance due to methane in their atmospheres.</li>
