<p>Solar System is a group of asteroids, comets, planets, dwarf plantes, and other celestial bodies that revolves in a star, the sun.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There is one star in our solar system, the sun, and it is where all the celestial bodies revolves around.</p>
<p>We have 8 planets on our solar system, excluding the dwarf planets. Those are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune,</p>
<h3>The 8 planets</h3>
<h4>Inner/Terrestrial planets</h4>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Mercury is the first in line, the smallest planet in the Solar System, and is very close to the Sun yet not the hottest.</li>
<li>Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition, but its environment is vastly different. it is called the hottest planet because of its atmosphere</li>
<li>Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system and the only known celestial body to harbor life. It is where we live. It's also the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.</li>
<li>Mars is the fourth planet and is often called "red planet" due to its reddish appearance.
</ol>
</p>
<h4> Outer/Jovian planets</h4>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is a captivating giant renowned for its immense size and turbulent atmosphere, highlighted by the iconic Great Red Spot.
<li>Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in our solar system, is renowned for its captivating system of rings, composed of ice particles, rock debris, and dust. 
<li>Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, presents a multitude of unique characteristics that continue to fascinate scientists and astronomers. Its extreme axial tilt, rotating almost perpendicular to its orbital plane, results in extreme seasonal variations, offering insights into its formation and evolution.
<li>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is a gas giant, similar in composition to Uranus, and is often referred to as an "ice giant" due to its composition primarily of hydrogen, helium, and icy materials like water, ammonia, and methane.
